                        <p className="lead my-3">In college administration, all departments are interrelated. They are manually maintained. As a result, they must
                            be automated and consolidated, as data from one department will be needed by others.</p>
                        <p className="lead my-3">CMS is advantageous since it has a simple user interface. The system employs sophisticated database
                            administration, data retrieval, and data manipulation capabilities. CMS makes it easier to handle data
                            than manually entering it into documents. The initiative is beneficial in terms of decreasing paperwork and
                            saving time.</p>
